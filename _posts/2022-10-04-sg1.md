title: "What is Symplectic Geometry?"

Since starting my PhD in symplectic geometry, my answer to the question to what I am doing has gotten more complicated. (Before I was mainly interested in [knot theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knot_theory), which offers itself to some more intuitive explanations.)
So I decided to give the usual answer in this post.

Like many mathematical topics, symplectic geometry has its origin in physics, more specifically classical mechanics, that is the part of physics you may have learnt in highschool, with the trajectories of objects being entirely described by their initial position and momentum and the forces acting upon them, disregarding any effects by relativity or quantum mechanics.

TODO: Insert animation illustrating Newtonian mechanics.

Let's discuss an example to illustrate what is going on: The Pendulum.  We have a weight somehow fixed on a circle (perhaps by a stiff, weightless rod fixed at a centre.). The state of the weight is described by its position on the circle (which we can choose to encode by the angle to the vertical line) and its momentum, which is.

First of all, since we currently don't care about the real physics, but only about the mathematical model, we can make some (from a physical perspective weird) simplifications: we choose to ignore all units, set the mass of our weight to 1, and also choose to have a gravitational acceleration of 1. (Note we already ignored units here.) Acting on it is the force of gravity. This is pointing straight down, but since our weight is fixed to the circle, we only regard the component tangential to the circle at a given position, so the force acting on the weight will be something like $$F_g = m g \sin(φ) = \sin(φ)$$. This means the angular acceleration will be $$a = F_g/m = sin(φ)$$, and the 

It turns out that this version [that is (Newtonian mechanics](todo)) is only one of some equivalent ways to describe the physics of classical mechanics. A (from a mathematical point of view) much more elegant description is given by Hamiltonian mechanics. Instead of looking at the forces acting upon each individual object, here the thing that determines how our system of objects will evolve is the **function of total energy**. This describes how much energy a certain state of a system holds.

In the case of the pendulum, the total energy is $$\frac{p}{2} - \cos(φ)$$, where the first term is the kinetic energy $$\frac{mv^2}{2} = \frac{p}{2m} = \frac{p}{2}$$, and the second is the potential energy $$-\cos(φ)*r$$



Origin: Classical Mechanics.

* Why would you want to treat position and momentum(velocity) independently?

* The harmonic oscillator\\
  →Area is being preserved!

* The coupled double harmonic oscillator\\
  →Sum of 2d areas is preserved.

Reducing to the essential:
What are the minimal things we need to describe a system?

* Some way to describe the space of position & momentum.

* Transform a Energy function into some vector field

How to find ω?

1. X_H depends (linearly) on dH/∇H (only local changes in energy determine the flow/ Newtons laws are linear differential equations)

2. dH → X_H ∈ Hom(T*M,TM) -> inverse Hom(TM,T*M) ≅ T*M⊗T*M
   want to solve ω_x(X_H(x),v) = dH_x(v) ∀ v ∈ TM -> ω non degenerate.
   -> ω_x ∈ Hom(T_xM,T_x*M) is iso.

3. dH(X_H) = 0 => ω_x(X_H(x),X_H(x)) = 0
   as ω_x is iso, this means ω is alternating -> diff form

4. φ_H^t*ω = ω (physical laws is independent of time) -> dω = 0
